            <p>	I enjoy working on everything from website design or (redesign!) to business cards and logos. I perform well using mostly Photoshop and Illustrator. I follow a design process that keeps me on track and allows me to stay productive while maximizing creative solutions! I have experience creating font pairings, color palettes, mood boards, site maps, user flows, wireframes logos and icons. I pride myself on design comps that are easy to follow and organized.  I strive to write clean code that is easy to read.  I have a solid foundation in HTML/CSS and am comfortable with Javascript.  I am a problem solver by nature and find the challenges of coding to be rewarding and motivating!

            <p>Originally from the Midwest, I've recently made my home in South Carolina with my husband, two kids and two dogs. My journey into tech started with the opening of my first business as a massage therapist.  I needed a website for my practice and after completing some free online courses, the site went live and I was hooked. Wanting to learn more I signed up for a web developer course at Skillcrush, where I learned how to design and code a portfolio site from scratch.
            Why yes, I built the very site you've landed on.  <em>(woot woot )</em><br>Creating my website, I have found the freedom &amp; passion I am looking for in a career. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development and web design, where I can use my math and art skills to write clean code with design elements that are eye-catching.  I love to dabble in photography, painting and Zendoodles.  Other things I find fantastic are spending time in nature, traveling, folk music, gardening and good books.</p>
